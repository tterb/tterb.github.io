# Welcome to Jekyll!
# In addition to these settings, there is a file _data/tokens-template.yml
# that you'll want to customize for your site. It's named 'tokens' because
# that was it's original purpose, but because tokens.yml is .gitexcluded, it's
# a good place to store your site-specific data that you'd rather not have
# forked or cloned. Of course, that means you'd want to back it up elsewhere.
